<!-- Hi !!!

I am working as a Researcher at the Robotics Research Center of IIIT Hyderabad where I am advised by [Dr. K. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/), [Dr. Sourav Garg](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=oVS3HHIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Arun Kumar Singh](https://tuit.ut.ee/en/content/arun-kumar-singh). Previoulsy, I working on Robust Visual Place Recognition as well as Robust Optimization in context of Multi Agent SLAM under the guidance of [Dr. K. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/) and [Dr. Joyjit Mukherjee](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/jmukherjee/Profile).

My work here revolves around the topics of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Representation Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics.

<!-- Hello!!!

I am working as an Independent Researcher, collaborating on an project at the intersection of Representation Learning and Visual Reinforcement Learning.

Before this, I was a researcher at RRC, IIIT Hyderabad, where I worked on robotic perception under guidance of [Dr. K. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/) and [Dr. Sourav Garg](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=oVS3HHIAAAAJ&hl=en). Along the way, I also explored generative modelling and drone navigation. I completed my undergraduate from [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) in Electronics and Communications Engineering. And did my bachelors thesis on Multi Agent SLAM.

My interests lie broadly in Representation Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Robotics. -->


<!-- Hello, I’m currently working as an Independent Researcher on a project at the intersection of Representation Learning and Visual Reinforcement Learning.

Hello, I'm currently an Independent Researcher working on interesting projects either in collaboration or individually. Prior to this, I was a researcher at the Robotics Research Center (RRC), IIIT Hyderabad, where I focused on robotic perception under the guidance of Prof. [K. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/) and Dr. [Sourav Garg](https://oravus.github.io/). Along the way, I also explored generative modeling and drone navigation.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Communications Engineering at [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/), where I wrote my bachelor’s thesis on Multi-Agent SLAM.

I am interested in creating intelligent systems that are as capable as humans. As part of this, I work under a broad range of topics like Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Representation Learning, etc.
