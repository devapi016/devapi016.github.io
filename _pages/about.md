Hi !!!

I am working as a Research Assistant at the Robotics Research Center of IIIT Hyderabad where I am advised by [Dr. K. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/), [Dr. Sourav Garg](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=oVS3HHIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Arun Kumar Singh](https://tuit.ut.ee/en/content/arun-kumar-singh).

My work falls under two broad problem statements.
- __*Object Detection/Segmentation in Adverse weather condition*__: Here, we extracted *represenations related to weather condition* to create weather invariant represenations and used them for better Segmentation.
- __*Drone Dynamics Modelling using Deep Learning*__: We are modelling Drone dynamics in Linear Space using *Koopman Theory* and use the obtained Linear model in path planning using *Convex Optimization*. Previously, we explored methods related to *Free-space estimation for faster Optimization* and *Diffusion based methods*.
 <!-- and *Physics Informed Neural Networks*.  -->

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, where I majored in B.E. Electronics and Communication Engineering with a bachelor's thesis, on Multi Agent SLAM (_[more info](https://github.com/devapi016/Undergraduate-Thesis-Report)_), under the guidance of [Dr. K. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/) and [Dr. Joyjit Mukherjee](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/jmukherjee/Profile).

<!-- My interests lie in AI/CV as well as its applications in the real world, especially through robotics. I want to create agents that can understand the data they get and use it efficiently to solve the problem at hand. Just like how humans do.  -->

**I am currently looking for research oppurtunities.** You can download my [CV](../assets/pdf/CV__SRI_MIHIR_DEVAPI_UNGARALA.pdf) from here.
