Hi !!!

I am working as a Researcher at the Robotics Research Center of IIIT Hyderabad where I am advised by [Dr. K. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/), [Dr. Sourav Garg](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=oVS3HHIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Arun Kumar Singh](https://tuit.ut.ee/en/content/arun-kumar-singh). Previoulsy, I working on Robust Visual Place Recognition as well as Robust Optimization in context of Multi Agent SLAM under the guidance of [Dr. K. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/) and [Dr. Joyjit Mukherjee](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/jmukherjee/Profile).

<!-- My research here comes under broad topic of Represenation Learning in Robotics. -->
<!-- My work here revolves around the topics of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Representation Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. --> -->

<b><b><i>Current Work</i></b></b>:
<ul>
<li>Depth Refinement and Completion using diffusion models.</li>
<li>Learning generalizable skills to adapt in unseen tasks.</li> Denoising depth images using diffusion models -->
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <b><b><i>Completed Work</i></b></b>:
<ul>
<li><b><b><i>Object Segmentation in Adverse weather condition</i></b></b>: Here, we extracted robust representations that are invariant to weather and used them for better Segmentation as well as Out-of-distribution performance.</li>
<li><b><b><i>SAM based Classification using Clustering</i></b></b>: We worked on using semantic information in SAM embeddings to classify objects via clustering with little to no training.</li>
<li><b><b><i>Koopman Operators for Linearizing Drone Dynamics</i></b></b>: We are linearizing Drone dynamics in Latent Space using <i>Koopman Theory</i> and use the obtained Linear model in path planning using <i>Convex Optimization</i>. </li> -->
<!-- <li><b><b><i>Other</i></b></b>: I worked on <i>Generative AI</i> and <i>Free-space estimation for faster Optimization using Deep Learning</i> for short time.</li> -->
 <!-- and *Physics Informed Neural Networks*.  -->

<!-- Previously, I was an undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, where I majored in B.E. Electronics and Communication Engineering with a bachelor's thesis, on Multi Agent SLAM (_[more info](https://github.com/devapi016/Undergraduate-Thesis-Report)_), under the guidance of [Dr. K. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/) and [Dr. Joyjit Mukherjee](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/jmukherjee/Profile). -->
<!-- __Interests__: I am interested  -->
<!-- My currect reseach interests are in Representation Learning in context of Generalization and Learning efficiently from given data(Extracting maximum info that is relevant to perform the task from data)  for human-like performance in case of Robotics or better performace in general. -->



<!-- My interests lie in AI/CV as well as its applications in the real world, especially through robotics. I want to create agents that can understand the data they get and use it efficiently to solve the problem at hand. Just like how humans do.  -->
