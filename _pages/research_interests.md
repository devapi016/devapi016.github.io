<!-- I am interested in creating intelligent systems that are as capable as humans. As part of this, I work under a broad range of topics like Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Representation Learning, etc. -->

My research explores how AI can learn from diverse data, experiences(self/others), and representations to build agents that can understand(perceive), reason, and adapt to novel situations and move toward human-like generalization in complex real-world environments.

As part of this, I work under a broad range of topics like Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Representation Learning, etc.
