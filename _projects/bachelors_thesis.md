In this report, we showcase our study on SLAM algorithms and Multi Agent SLAM algorithms followed by the key components that are necessary to make SLAM algorithm into a Multi SLAM algorithm. Then we took an open source SLAM algorithim i.e., VINS-Mono and added SOTA algorithms ([Graduated Non-Convexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08605), [NetVLAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07247)) to it and created a Multi agent framework. We discussed about our implementation Multi Agent SLAM algorithm and design choices for it in the report.
